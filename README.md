# Elements Game Engine

> An awesome game engine to learn C++, Vulkan, computer graphics rendering and most importantly to have fun.

`Currently working on refactoring Vulkan code in refactoring branch.`

## Current Progress

- [x] Window creation and resizing using GLFW
- [x] Keyboard and Mouse Input
- [x] Logging
- [ ] GUI setup using ImGUI (In progress)
- [ ] Vulkan setup (In progress)
- [ ] Building 2d renderer

## The Architecture

The Elements Project provides the framework to develop games.

The Playground Project is where I test rendering and apply the framework.

The messaging framework also handles communication between different systems in the framework. (Might be replaced by some other sytem such as an event queue.)
